      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Zoo Story&amp;rdquo; is a one-act play by Edward Albee that explores the themes of isolation, communication, and class conflict in modern society. The play takes place on a bench in New York City&amp;rsquo;s Central Park, where Peter, a middle-class executive, is approached by Jerry, a lonely and unpredictable stranger. As their conversation unfolds, Jerry&amp;rsquo;s sinister intentions become clear, leading to a violent and shocking conclusion that forces Peter to confront his own sense of identity and purpose in life.</description>
