Swipe right, swipe left, swipe right … The only thing Lucas goes through faster than beer is the dates he goes on. Until he meets Maya, a down-to-earth mature girl who isn’t afraid of being herself. Lucas struggles to deepen the connection and realises he has not dealt with a previous loss in his life.
