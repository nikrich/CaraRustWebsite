"The Zoo Story" is a one-act play by Edward Albee that explores the themes of isolation, communication, and class conflict in modern society. The play takes place on a bench in New York City's Central Park, where Peter, a middle-class executive, is approached by Jerry, a lonely and unpredictable stranger. As their conversation unfolds, Jerry's sinister intentions become clear, leading to a violent and shocking conclusion that forces Peter to confront his own sense of identity and purpose in life.
